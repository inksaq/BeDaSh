# FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION IMPLEMENTATION

## Setup Steps for Firebase Authentication Login System

1.  **Uncomment Firebase Auth dependency in app/build.gradle**
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
    ```
2.  **Update MainActivity.java with Firebase Authentication Code**
    *   Added Firebase Auth initialization
    *   Implemented user session management
    *   Created login and registration functionality
    *   Added a 1-second splash screen
    *   Implemented logout capability
3.  **Create or Update activity_main.xml Layout**
    *   Added three main layout sections:
        *   Splash screen layout
        *   Login/Register form
        *   Main content area after authentication
    *   Added necessary UI components:
        *   Email and password input fields
        *   Login, Register, and Logout buttons
        *   Progress indicator
        *   Status text displays
4.  **Testing the Authentication**
    *   Run the app to see the splash screen
    *   Create a new account using the registration form
    *   Test login functionality with the created account
    *   Verify logout works correctly
    *   Confirm session persistence (staying logged in)
5.  **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**
    *   Make sure `google-services.json` is properly placed in the `app` directory
    *   Ensure Firebase project has Authentication enabled in the Firebase Console
    *   For testing, enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
    *   If experiencing issues, check Firebase Console for error logs
    *   Verify internet connection as authentication requires online connectivity
6.  **Code Structure**
    *   Firebase Initialization: In `onCreate()` method
    *   UI Components: Set up in `initializeViews()` method
    *   Authentication Logic: Handled by Firebase Auth methods
    *   Navigation Flow:
        *   Splash Screen (1 second) → Check user status → Login/Register screen or Main Content
        *   Successful login/registration → Main Content
        *   Logout → Login/Register screen
7.  **Security Considerations**
    *   Keep `google-services.json` file secure and don't commit it to public repositories
    *   Always validate user input
    *   Consider implementing email verification
    *   For production, add appropriate error handling and analytics
    *   Consider implementing additional authentication methods (Google, Facebook, etc.)
